# OwlTasker
A very simple CLI tasklist tool.

Quickly add, view, and manage tasks without opening an editor.
   

## Installation
**This is a user-local installation (no root required) - Make sure ~/.local/bin is in your PATH**  

### Automatically
```bash 
git clone https://github.com/cturpn/Tools.git
cd Tools/OwlTasker
bash install.sh
```

### Manually

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cturpn/Tools.git
cd Tools/OwlTasker
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
cp OwlTasker.sh ~/.local/bin/OwlTasker
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/OwlTasker
```

## How it works

Tasks are stored in a Markdown file with this format:
```
### Task <nr>: <Title>
   | Date: <DateOfCreation>  
   | Description: <CustomDesc>  
   | Deadline: <CustomDeadline>  
```
They can be created (obviously), listed and deleted. 

## Usage
```
OwlTasker -h            # Show help and usage  
OwlTasker -t				# List all tasks  
OwlTasker -c				# Create a new task  
OwlTasker -d <nr>|all	# Delete a specific task or all tasks  
```
### Notes:  
    Task numbers (<nr>) are assigned automatically.  
    The task file path is fixed after installation; no runtime configuration is needed.  
    All commands read/write to the same Markdown file.
